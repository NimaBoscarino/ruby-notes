# W 7 D 2
# MORE RUBY AND OOP - OOPs, I did it again

- OOP stuff
  - React
- Server stuff
  - Express

REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE

- Bundler
- ORM (Active Record)

DO AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE

## Bundler - CHECK

- npm (making a package json and installing stuff to it)

## ORM - Object Relational Mapping

Object

OOP 

Javascript has prototypes

Ruby has classes

- a custom type of thing
  - properties
  - behaviours
  - have a lineage of inheritance

Interacting with databases

Knex.
- constructing queries in a Javascript kinda way.

- doesn't care what DB we're talking to
- layer of abstraction
  
ActiveRecord
- instead of returning rows, it will return actual OBJECTS OF THAT TYPE.
  - WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT OOP STUFF

# ORM - WHEN WE RUN A 'query'

# CONVENTION OVER CONFIGURATION


Look at ! versions of things.
