# W 7 D 2: More OOP and Active Record

## OOPs I did it again

Ruby!

- programming language
- add 1 plus 1
- 1 + 1
- 1 plus 1
- + 1 1 // reverse something notation

Objects in Ruby !== Objects in Javascript

Objects in Ruby are like real-life instances of a thing.

NPM
===

- node package manager
- It is a program used to manage packages on your machine
  - also to run tasks (npm run start, npm run local)
  - install from npmjs.com, OR other places.
  - `npm` looks at package.json
- A service that hosts packages (little bits of useful javascript code) (npmjs.com)
 

A `user` can `befriend` `someone (another user)`

knex.query('SELECT * FROM USERS where id = 12')

// [{name: 'Jim', age: 7812631, food: 'pizza'}]

// a whole other query to get friends...

jim.addFriend(sally)
